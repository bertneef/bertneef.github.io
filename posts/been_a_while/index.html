  <p>Well it&rsquo;s been about 2.5 years since my previous entry. Kept thinking I should get back to this but just never seemed to get round to it.
What has happened in the meantime:</p>
<ul>
<li>I stopped running due to an injury, probably due to trying to hard and not using decent enough shoes, this injury kept playing up when I tried to get back into running again, so after a while I just stopped trying and accepted</li>
<li>About a year after that I joined a gym, rebuild some of my endurance and gained a bit of strength</li>
<li>Took up running again, first on a tread mill and then on the street again. Moved from 5 to 10KM runs</li>
<li>Improved my speed, improved my distances, have run a few runs of more than 22KM</li>
<li>Ran my first 8KM race last Sunday, couldn&rsquo;t hit the time I wanted, lost a bit too much time in getting past slower runners, but it was fun. Definitely something I would like to do again, which is a good thing because I already signed up for a 15KM race before running the 8KM</li>
</ul>
<p>So I have gone beyond my expectations, of course the downside is that I now own multiple pairs of running shoes and have clothes I only use for running / the gym. Which also is something I never expected.</p>
<p>Running looks like it&rsquo;s here to stay, but it&rsquo;s not the only fun thing I am rediscovering.
I have also spend a bit more time looking into my coding/scripting, I like to do the occasional data wrangling/reporting which have led me to undertake two projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean up my Reeder feeds by checking the OPML export and finding dead / no longer relevant RSS/Atom feeds</li>
<li>Automate some pipeline wrangling to make sure follow up opportunities are present</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this with a bit of R. Looking forward to that.</p>
