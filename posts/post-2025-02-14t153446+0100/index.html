  <h1>LLM as a coding assistant</h1>
  <time datetime=2025-02-14T15:34:46&#43;0100 class="post-date">Fri, Feb 14, 2025</time>
  <p>Having written the pipeline wrangling Shiny script (around 80 lines of R code) the old fashioned way I was curious to see how LLMs would handle it. Having access to MS Copilot and to the free tier of Claude I have tried both of these.</p>
<p>To keep it fair I tried the same prompt with both, and the results were very close for both LLMs, I asked for a partial match for &ldquo;Won&rdquo; in a certain field and Claude coded an exact match, both LLMs showed row numbers in the datagrids which I had explicitely asked for not to be shown and in both cases irrelevant old data was shown, due to improper handling of dates.</p>
<p>In Claude I used two messages to fix the issues, one for the partial match and another one for the row numbers and irrelevant data. In Copilot I have given up in fruststration, I can get some things fixed but I really have to provide clear hints based on my own understanding of R. So while in Claude I moved on to improving the script with nicer presentation (something I didn&rsquo;t bother with in my own attempt) I have decided not to waste too much time on Copilot for code generation.</p>
<p>Of course Claude isn&rsquo;t perfect either, previous attempts were better than Copilot but still ran into strange issues. In this case I am trying to get some layout fixes in, it&rsquo;s getting there but I am out of free messages. But that&rsquo;s just improvements, I managed to get something better than what I had come up on my own in a very short amount of time. Of course it helps to have done the work before so I can write better prompts :)</p>
<p>In summary: when doing anything with coding, look to Claude first instead of Copilot.</p>
