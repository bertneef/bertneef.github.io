  <p>To follow up on my previous posts, I have tried to recreate the OPML check script I created for the Reeder OPML export through LLMs, no luck yet with Claude or Copilot. I know Microsoft Copilot is based on ChatGPT but I was curious if there was a difference in ability, so I logged into the ChatGPT app. Trying the same prompt I had tried with Claude and Copilot. The first result looked very promising, it didn&rsquo;t reference a R package which was no longer on CRAN, and it managed to process quite a few entries in the OPML file without any issues. It did run into an issue later on but that was easily fixed by a single message to ChatGPT with the error message. Overall I was impressed.
Next step was to reattempt the pipeline wrangling Shiny script. It produced a working version with the initial prompt, I moved on to improvements and through a rather smooth process I ended up with something which was fit for purpose and maintainable.</p>
<p>So before today I would have reached to Claude for coding assistance first I now will give ChatGPT a try first, if it doesn&rsquo;t produce results I can always look at Claude.
And in the future I may just attempt to tackle some coding/scripting approaches to problems which would have been too hard / too time consuming for my limited skills with the help of LLMs, analytical thinking should get me to the proper prompts and with my skills I should be able to get it working from there. Lets see.</p>
