      <description>On Friday I passed my AWS Solution Architect Professional exam. I did spend some time studying but since technology builds upon existing layers, I could build upon my existing knowledge and experience. Foundational layers related to Business Continuity or DNS always pop up, and having been advising customers about Azure, designing and developing solutions upon Azure for the last 6 years helps with a cloud mindset which is not really that different between AWS and Azure.</description>

      <description>Today I ran 5KM. And altough it&amp;rsquo;s nothing special, plenty of people run greater distances each day for me it was a first. My time was actually worse than expected but it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter, I had proven my past self wrong. For years I was sure I couldn&amp;rsquo;t run at all, anything above a 100M was simply impossible. But about 7 weeks ago something changed and I just tried running for half a minute.</description>
